# HotspotLatency

Measure latency by running a simple bash script using cron in linux.

Plot using R.

Note: Going through a VPN appears to give more accurate results. My ISP (Cox) has different quality of connection to different hotspots. In fact, the Cox->Cox connection I tested is worse than a Cox->AT&T DSL connection.
